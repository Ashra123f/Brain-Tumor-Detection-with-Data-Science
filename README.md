# Brain-Tumor-Detection-with-Data-Science
Brain tumor detection using data science involves analyzing medical images, such as MRI scans, to identify the presence and characteristics of brain tumors. This process often includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, and the use of machine learning algorithms for classification. By training models on labeled data, these algorithms can learn to differentiate between healthy brain tissue and tumor tissue, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.And holds the potential to improve early diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes by providing accurate and efficient analysis of medical images.
